Over winter break of my freshman year, I went with a couple of friends to a climbing gym. I had been climbing before as a kid, but we had so much fun that we continued to visit our campus gym multiple times per week. I loved the combination of working out and problem solving, and I have been going about three times per week since the start of 2021.

I primarily boulder inside, where the wall is typically less than 15 feet tall and you just fall on to a crash pad on the floor. I enjoy the process of working through difficult moves and the payoff from eventually sending the problem, and I climb around V5-V6 indoors.

I have also gotten the opportunity to climb some outdoors! Two of my major trips have been to Moab, Utah and Rumney Rocks, New Hampshire. Here are a couple of pictures from these amazing trips.

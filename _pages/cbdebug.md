# **Debugging Concept Bottleneck Models through Removal and Retraining**

!

[A concise, impactful sentence summarizing the project and its key contribution.]

---

## **Abstract**

[A short, one-paragraph abstract that explains the problem, your proposed solution (using your CBM), and the main results. This is often the same as the paper's abstract.]

---

## **Key Contributions**

* **[Contribution 1]** (e.g., A novel method for incorporating interpretability into model design.)
* **[Contribution 2]** (e.g., A new evaluation metric for assessing interpretability and information leakage.)
* **[Contribution 3]** (e.g., State-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the practical benefits of your approach.)

## **Demonstration / Gallery**

Visuals are critical for these pages. This section should include:

* ****: A side-by-side comparison of a standard black-box model and your CBM, showing the interpretable concepts.
* ****: A graph showing how your method's performance compares to other baselines. This is a chance to highlight key metrics from your paper.

In the summer of 2021 I worked under Sihong Xie on a multi-objective optimization method for fair graphical models. The goal of the project was to create a better pareto front, a tradeoff curve between objectives, for any fairness vs. accuracy problem. We utilized a predictor corrector method to increase the algorithm's speed for finding points on this pareto front, and worked on using krylov recycling to save subspace information between each step to generate a pareto front even faster.

In the summer of 2022 I worked under Lin Tan on data-free model extraction. Model extraction is the process of stealing the performance of a black-box model, and our goal was to improve the query efficiency of these algorithms.

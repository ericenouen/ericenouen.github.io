# A Predictor-Corrector Method for fair Graph Spam Detection
## June 2021 - May 2022
My first research opportunity was through an REU at Lehigh University under the supervision of Sihong Xie.

on a multi-objective optimization method for fair graphical models. The goal of the project was to create a better pareto front, a tradeoff curve between objectives, for any fairness vs. accuracy problem. We utilized a predictor corrector method to increase the algorithm's speed for finding points on this pareto front, and worked on using krylov recycling to save subspace information between each step to generate a pareto front even faster.

Preprint not yet available.

# DisGUIDE: Disagreement-Guided Data-Free Model Extraction
## June 2022 - August 2022
Next, I got the chance to work under Lin Tan at Purdue University through another REU.
I worked under Lin Tan on data-free model extraction. Model extraction is the process of stealing the performance of a black-box model, and our goal was to improve the query efficiency of these algorithms.

Paper submitted to AAAI-23, awaiting review.

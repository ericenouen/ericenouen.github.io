title: About Me
---

I'm a fourth year undergraduate at The Ohio State University studying Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. I love learning about the field of AI in any way I can, and love tackling hard research problems to find a solution.

My research has focused on **trustworthy machine learning**. There are many pillars underlying the goal of trustworthy ML: fairness, security, explainability, robustness, and responsibility. Improving on these core principles will be crucial for creating systems that benefit the society they are deployed in.

I plan to continue my education by joining a PhD program in the fall of 2024. Outside of work, I also enjoy rock climbing and spending time outdoors.

title: About Me
---

I'm a third year undergraduate at The Ohio State University studying Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. I love learning about the field of AI in any way I can, and love tackling hard research problems to find a solution. Outside of work, I enjoy rock climbing and spending time outdoors.

My research has focused on developing **trustworthy machine learning models** that benefit the society they are deployed in. My work so far has focused on two main aspects of developing trustworthy models: security and fairness. My work on feasible data-free model extraction shows a vulnerability in current deployed models, which could be exploited by an adversary to extract training data, find adversarial examples, or avoid payments for a service. This exposes security issues with the way models are currently deployed. My work on fair graph spam detection has focused on a method for simultaneously optimizing performance and fairness objectives, working to develop an algorithm that prioritizes fairness jointly with performance.

I plan to continue my education and improve my research skills by joining a PhD program in the fall of 2024.

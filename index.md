I'm a second year PhD student at Cornell University studying Computer Science, advised by [Sainyam Galhotra](https://sainyamgalhotra.com/). Prior to Cornell, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from The Ohio State University. I am supported by the 2025–2026 Bowers CIS–LinkedIn Fellowship.

I am broadly interested in responsible machine learning, with a particular focus on how incorporating interpretability into the model design process can provide leverage on broader sociotechnical challenges such as fairness, robustness, and accountability.

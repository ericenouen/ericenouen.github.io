---

I'm a first year PhD student at Cornell University studying Computer Science, advised by Prof. [Sainyam Galhotra](https://sainyamgalhotra.com/). 

I am interested in Interpretable Machine Learning and developing trustworthy systems that benefit the society they are deployed in. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in similar things or have any questions for me!

title: About Me
---

I'm a third year undergraduate at The Ohio State University studying Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. I love learning about the field of AI in any way I can, and love tackling hard research problems to find a solution. Outside of work, I enjoy rock climbing and spending time outdoors.

My research has focused on improving Machine Learning algorithms to solve real world problems such as balancing fairness and accuracy or extracting performance from a pretrained model. I plan to continue my education and improve my research skills by joining a PhD program in the fall of 2024.
